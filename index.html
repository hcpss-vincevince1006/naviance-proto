  <h2><i class="fa fa-bar-chart" aria-hidden="true"></i> Success Tracking for Middle and High School Students</h2>
  <p>Students take strengths assessments, identify careers of interest, explore college options, and much more to prepare for life after high school. During senior year, students request transcripts and letters of recommendation to be sent to their colleges of choice. Since students are already familiar with Naviance, requesting documents is a seamless next step in the process.</p>
